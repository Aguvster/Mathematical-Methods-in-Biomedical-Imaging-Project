## Usage
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run create_dataset.py
3. Run main.py (you'll get a warning, ignore it and just wait until completion)
4. Optionally, Run main.py -h to customize parameters
5. Even more optionally, if you want to try another image, add it to the list IMAGES in create_dataset.py

"theta.png" is the result, and is updated each step of the SGD.
